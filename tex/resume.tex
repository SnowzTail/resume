\section{\faBookmarkO\ Projects}
\datedsubsection{\textit{Signal Optimization for Wireless Information and Power Transmission}}{2019 -- Present}
We investigated a novel harvester nonlinear model based on the Taylor expansion of diode \textit{I--V} characteristics and performed a signal design on top of it. A superposition of modulated information and multisine power waveform is jointly optimized with the splitting ratio according to the CSI, power budget and rate constraint. Based on non-convex posynomial maximization, the iterative algorithms were demonstrated to benefit the rate-energy tradeoff especially for high SNR and multi-band transmissions. It may help trillions of low-power devices to get rid of batteries by efficiently utilizing the energy and information carried by RF signals.

\datedsubsection{\textit{Cross-Layer Optimization for 4G Broadband Wireless Communication Networks}}{2018}
We proposed an adaptive low-complexity cross-layer design across the PHY and MAC layer to determine the data packet transmission order according to the traffic characteristics and CSI. PD and M-LWDF scheduling were combined with M-MWC and M-WF allocation for flexible traffic control. With a proper packet selecting strategy, the proposed algorithm was proved to increase the spectrum and power efficiency while significantly reduce the delay, outage, and packet drop rate. We also explore the performance on new services as haptic.
