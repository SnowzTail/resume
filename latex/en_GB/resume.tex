\section{\faBookmarkO\ Research Projects}
\datedsubsection{\textit{Signal Optimisation for Wireless Information and Power Transmission}}{2019 -- Present}
Start from \textit{I--V} characteristics of the rectifier, we proved that a novel nonlinear energy harvester model leads to a larger rate-energy region, and a two-fold benefit can be achieved by a superposition of modulated information waveform and deterministic \textit{(e.g. multisine)} power waveform. Also, TS receiver is preferred for few tones and low SNR but overpowered by PS in opposite cases. It may bring more opportunities to IoT and accelerate the progress of powering trillions of devices wirelessly.

\datedsubsection{\textit{Cross-Layer Optimisation for 4G Broadband Wireless Communication Networks}}{2018}
We implemented an adaptive low-complexity cross-layer design across the PHY and MAC layer for OFDM systems. PD and M-LWDF scheduling were combined with M-MWC and M-WF allocation for flexible control. With a proper packet selecting strategy, the proposed model increased the resource efficiency while significantly reduced delay, outage and packet drop rate. Support for haptic-related applications as VR was investigated.
